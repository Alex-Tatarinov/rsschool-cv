## About Me: 
My name is Alexander. I am 27 years old. I grew up and live in the city of Bryansk, which is located in Russia. He graduated from college as a theater director. I play the guitar, read books and comics, collect and play video games, and am also an organizer of many events related to hobbies and cultural recreation. I work in the catering industry, as a cook in a hot shop. In my search for myself, I came to the conclusion that the most useful and interesting profession for me is front-end developer. That's why I'm here.
